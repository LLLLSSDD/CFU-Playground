### A full stack workshop for accelerating TinyML with CFUs

TinyML is an emerging field at the intersection of embedded systems and machine learning. 

To this end, in an effort to help the community grow, we are developing a full stack workshop for building efficient & accelerated TinyML solutions using our open source tool, CFU-Playground, for rapid and iterative development & exploration.
