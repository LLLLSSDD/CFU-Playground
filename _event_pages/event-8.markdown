title:  "Navigating CFU Playground"
---

CFU Playground is a collection of many different packages. 
Below we have outlined where some of the commonly asked for files are outside of developing a CFU.
All paths specified begin from your local CFU-Playground root.

* TOC
{:toc}
</div>

### Software
* General software (menus, microbenchmarks): `common/src/`
  * TFLM Models:`common/src/models`
* LiteX low-level library source: `third_party/python/litex/litex/soc/software/`
* TFLM (updated from upstream automatically): `third_party/tflite-micro/`
* Project-specific source: `proj/[project_name]/src`

*Precedence*: The software build directory is started by copying the TFLM code.  Then any files under `common/src` will overlay TFLM file at the same path; then finally any files in `proj/[projct_name]/src` will overlay any of the preceding and therefore take precedence.

### Gateware
* VexRiscv CPU RTL:`soc/vexriscv`
* Litex SoC source: `third_party/python/lite*/`


### Hardware
* Workflow for each board:`soc/board_specific_workflows` 

### Tools
* RISC-V Compiler if using Conda: `CFU-Playground/env/conda/envs/cfu-common/bin`
* OSS FPGA tools if using Conda: `CFU-Playground/env/conda/envs/cfu-common/{bin,share,lib}`
* Renode: `third_party/renode`


### Misc
* Third Party: `third_party/` (contains src for Renode, TFLM, and other python packages, etc. needed and used in CFU-Playground) 

### Generated by your builds
* Software build: `proj/[project_name]/build/src`
* Software binary: `proj/[project_name]/build/software.bin`
* Softare disassembly: `proj/[your project]/build/software.elf.dis`
* Gateware build: `soc/build/[board].[project_name]/gateware/`
  * Synthesis Stats: `soc/build/[board].[project_name]/gateware/[board].rpt` (if using nextpnr)
  * Bitstream: `soc/build/[board].[project_name]/gateware/[board].bit`
* Software info generated by LiteX: `soc/build/[board].[project_name]/software/include/generated/*`
  * the headers in this directory contain much useful information about your platform that software can use
