CFU Playground is a collection of many different packages. 
Below we have outlined where some of the commonly asked for files are outside of developing a CFU.
All paths specified begin from your local CFU-Playground root.

### Software
* TFLM Models:`common/src/models`
* General software (menus, microbenchmarks): `common/src/`
* RISC-V Compiler if using Conda: `CFU-Playground/env/conda/envs/cfu-common/bin`

### Gateware
* VexRiscv CPU RTL:`soc/vexriscv`
* Litex SoC source: `third_party/python/lite*/`

* Bitstream:

### Hardware
* Renode: `third_party/renode`
* Workflow for each board:`soc/board_specific_workflows` 

### Misc
* Third Party: `third_party/` (contains src for Renode, TFLM, and other python packages, etc. needed and used in CFU-Playground) 
  * TFLM (updated from upstream automatically): `third_party/tflite-micro/`

### Generated by your builds
* Software build: `proj/[your project]/build/src`
* Software binary: `proj/[your project]/build/software.bin`
* Softare disassembly: `proj/[your project]/build/software.elf.dis`
* Gateware build: `soc/build/[board].[project_name]/gateware/`
  * Synthesis Stats: `soc/build/[board].[project_name]/gateware/[board].rpt` (if using nextpnr)
* Software info generated by LiteX: `soc/build/[board].[project_name]/software/include/generated/*`
  * the headers in this directory contain much useful information about your platform that software can use
